          <p>Productivity is not a question of how much time a day you spend working. Sometimes, a day in which you’ve
            worked for just three or four hours can end up being much more productive than a day in which you’ve been
            trying to work for more than eight. Have you ever experienced this?</p>

            <p>Lack of focus is one of the greatest enemies of productivity. Constant — and often inefficient —
              meetings, colleagues who are constantly interrupting, phone calls, and any other distraction, lower your
              performance and make you waste time and energy, not just working but trying to do whatever other activity.

            <h1>Vission</h1>
            <br>
            <p>Create an appropriate framework. Keep your desk clean and tidy, and remove anything that might distract
              you. Keep everything you might need handy (even a bottle of water) to reduce the chances of having to
              interrupt what you’re doing.If you work sitting, having a good chair is essential.</p>

            <p>Besides being good for your health, eating right will help you to be more productive. When you’re hungry
              it’s really hard to stay focused on something (personally I can’t focus at all if I’m hungry), and if you
              eat too much, you’ll be overcome by sleep. Caffeine and sugar can help you (in moderation of course).</p>

            <p>Normally you have a high level of energy and concentration at the beginning of the day, which gradually
              decreases throughout the day. But not everyone works the same way. Also, if you work at home, your
              circumstances may be very different. Discover how you feel at different times of the day and set your
              routines accordingly. Leave repetitive task for lower-energy moments.

        <p> It’s easier to stay focused on something when you bear in mind why you are doing whatever it is you’re
          doing. Using an organizational system such as GTD, which encourages you to relate your daily activity to
          significant goals, is highly recommended.</p>
